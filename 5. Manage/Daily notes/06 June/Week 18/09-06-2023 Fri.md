Meeting with Elise and Pieter


____
For meeting with Elise and Pieter: 
Suggestions: 
* Change goal tag colors (leave border and maybe icon, backgr like col tag) 
* Remove sorter by type
* Date filter - should we keep the sorter? 
* Feedback status tags will change colors, right?
* Orphaned evidence  - filter by none or not linked (avoids confusing name) 
* Option to edit tags in evidence detail view.
Todo: *ask to test the epic*
