The requirments were well received and interesting, liked the fact that I drew ideas from mobile and desktop file manager next to other eportfolios.

Suggested to start sketching different versions of the requirements (all not gonna happen).
V1: Use existing list view but add up to 3 new things to it.
V2: Use card system to change the look and several new features.
V3: Use a tree system for all evidence + no clue how yet, need to think about itâ€¦ðŸ’­

Then make figma prototypes and meet again! ðŸ˜‰

Bonus, look at antDesign for drawer, card, dropdown ideas and icons.
