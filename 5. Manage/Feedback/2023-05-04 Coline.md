Discussed progress made and the importance of prioritization. At the moment I have too much, thus we should identify key tasks and work our way through. We made a plan to list all tasks during our peer coding session and then I should check it with the tutor to stay in line with internship expectetations. Afterwards, we will make a prioritization table next week.
