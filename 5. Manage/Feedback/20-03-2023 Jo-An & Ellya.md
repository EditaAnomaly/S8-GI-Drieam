* Week 17 is the portfolio deadline (to submit all), thus rethink the schedule and phases a bit to accommodate that
* Regarding the design, take a lok at the checkpoints as they are tipicaly the first column not the last (look at gmail, ant design and other examples)
* Check in with Caro about EduFrame and ask to show various tables there, ask why they are designed this way
* I should be able to validate every design decision made (wether via expert interviewsor proffesional design guideliness/ research supporting it)
* Use triangulation (would be best)
* It is very important to have those conversations with UX designers and ask those questions
