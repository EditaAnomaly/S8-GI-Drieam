Showed examples of EduFrame and suggested improvements on my designs. 
* Search bar should be pulled out of the table
* No need to sort by name
* No need to sort by date (as its default)
* Create a datepicker from-until next to search bar
* Move add evidence to the right
* Bulk delete should be the leftest column
* Add evidence and collections could be the extra kebab btn at the end of the row
* This kebab btn would also hold a singular delete
* When selecting multiple - display up top how much is selected and what actions are possible
