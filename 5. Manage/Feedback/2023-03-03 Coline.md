I shouldn't rush, stay in research and analysis stage,
List out all the requirements and potential improvements for Evidence Section (ES),
Refine and sort them, make a MoSCoW table,
Then talk to Pieter and Elise to make sure I don't stray from their vision for ESm,
Only if/when they agree on requirements start designing.
In addition, look into typescript and react more as I prefer the front-end.
