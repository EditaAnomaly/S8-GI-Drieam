I presented my latest versions on Evidence section improvement (v5, v6, v7) and discussed next steps. Received the following feedback: 
* I should start developing as soon as possible, the fear is that my agile way discribed in PP is turning more into waterfall
* "Clear filters" could be replaced with a hint to interact with dashboard when no filter is applied
* Put my focus on the table first
* Keep the dashboard as minimal as possible
* Try to reuse existing components
* Pieter (PO) really liked the design
* Dashboard would add a lot of value to My Evidence section
	* Hiding dashborad would be nice to have as extra but not a neccessity
* Focus on all filtering to take place inside the table for now (except the search by name, use what already is)
* Separate the columns into Linked Collections and Linked Goals (it will be easier)
* Enable to Filter by the goals and collections (with checkboxes)
* Date should be clarified, perhaps its best to use the first created evidence date
* Use antDesign components and try not to change the CSS much
* +Add Evidence should be a ghost button and not a primary one to maintain consistency with other tabs of portflow
* Badges in the dashboard are confusing use the pill instead as it looks like notifications now and not counters
* Figure out the bulk actions (manage collections and delete?), keep in mind that delete bulk is very complex
* Start by divinding tasks, come op with epics and schedule a refinement session with Coline and Ellya for next Tuesday
* Make a list of all actions I would like to do and they will help me prioritize it
* Make only static dashboard at best
* Consider alternating colors between rows, may help improve readability when there is a lot of evidence
* Keep evidence section on infinite schroll as pagination may add load due to keeping track of counters and quering the db extra (check with Matthijs)
* Add tooltip on evidence Type to display the type in text on hover
* Shedule coding Fridays with Coline
