Demoed my V4 card menu for dashboard with detailed list table below. Received the following feedback: 
* Add x in the corner of the card on hover (to make it clear for users that it can be unclicked) 
* Switch versions and date, as date is more useful to sort by
* Make 8 cards in total: 5 types (include LMS/Canvas assignment) + Orphaned Evidence + Evidence with no feedback + Pending Feedback Evidence
* A little "i" above  table headers for explanation i.e., Feedback status
* Table in ant design can have an integrated search option (use it for name)
* Date and Name could also offer sort options in the header
* + Add Evidence button should be blue as a main button
* Replace trash button with kebab menu icon to offer more options: delete (bulk) selected, add to collections (all selected)
* After making changes of the row needs to dissapear - highlight it for a few seconds and then disappear
* For Feedback icons use: chat buble with clock/hourglass and chat bubble with an X
* For orphans icon use: folder with an x or a ?
* Make icons using fontawesome.com  (need premium version)
