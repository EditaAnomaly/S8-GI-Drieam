First meeting with the tutor and other students where we shared what our internships are about and how we are doing. I received the folowing advice and suggestions:
* Mention its iteratable in the reflection
* Can use portflow to submit, but keep outsiders in mind, thus having a repo with a nice wiki is also a good idea
* In case of portfolio, it is a must to have a readings guide (up to 2 A4 pages) on what is where
* Good to have a Report with a general process overview and why we did what we did
* Explain why antDesign is a good choice (compare with material design) why is it good with react
* Overall, very good progress
