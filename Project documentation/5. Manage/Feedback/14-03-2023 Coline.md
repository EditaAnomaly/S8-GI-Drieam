Updated Coline on my progress and efforts until this point, demoed the requirements and wireframes. Received the following suggestions:
* Better use a table to Filter, Sort and Search from antDesign it offers ways to combine all current filters (from V4)
* No need for Cards, only a functional table could do the same job
* Disagrees on buttons for types
* A Separate dasboard above the table could offer counts and summaries of the applied filters i.e., You have 37 evidence with the name "xxx", 25 of them are pending feedback , 6 of them have more than 1 version, 1 of them has no comments or sth alike.
* Perhaps come back again to the list view vs card view option and let users choose their preffered look.
* Check out PortflowUserDay event in Tillburg (only in dutch, for teachers - my target is studets)
* Consider diverging again from V4 and make 2 new suggestions: one with smart table and one with actual dashboard. 
* The actual dashboard could offer visuals for example, evidence in total and how much of it has more than 1V, or feedback pending, or no feedback or is of a certain type. Explore such visuals.
* Clear filters button would be needed
Key take away: make 3 versions again >> Pieter version (fix V4 as per Pieter's feedback)
															>> Coline Version (a smart antDesign table)
															>> Dashboard Version
Bonus: consider dedicating a day a week to work on tickets (code with the team).
