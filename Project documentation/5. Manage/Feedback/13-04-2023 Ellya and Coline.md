The mid-term review feedback discussion

The mentors shared their feedback docuement with me and I reviewed the results. Though I agreed with the outcome, I was able to ask any questions.
We discussed my future plans and worries regarding my career path, they shared their career stories in return. It was a really good really honest and down to earth conversation. They also gave me the following advice: 
* Traversy media javascript tutorial >> link on slack, do it a couple of hours a week
* Take more leadership, i.e., for the next refinement session organize it all
* How to prepare a demo (check the list of commits on RM) and make a list of changes and practice to demo it all, try to demo for the next meeting.
