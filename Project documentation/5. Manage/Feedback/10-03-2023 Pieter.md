I showed my requirements, inspiration and the sketches, explained my versions and design.
He said I did a nice job and suggested to combine V1 and V2 in an interesting way. 

Use the cards  (V2) to create presets to toggle view that would serve as a dashboard but leave the "detailed list view" from V1 underneath.  The presets would help sort/filter contents and show counters i.e. per filetype (3 videos, 2 links, 15 files etc), 8 orphaned evidence  (display all evidence that is not linked to any collections), 1 Pending feedback evidence.

‚ùï Important to know that evidence can not be linked to goals without a context of collections. 
Collections are just tags/labels but goals are evidence within a collection. I.e., same evidence can be linked to 2 collections and then with 2 goals per each collection.
