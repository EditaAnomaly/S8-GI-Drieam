Demoed all my verions (V1-V4 + V5 first sketch) and discussed the next steps. Received the follwing tips: 
* Consider combining #comments and FeedbackStatus using Badges (to display counter and save space)
* Cards and tree/map are still very nice ideas, perhaps use cards above for V5 to display summary of stats (counters)
* Toggle button could help emphasize the Orphans (use the example in My Access & requests -> Feedback req.) it would toggle the filter of all orphans
* For the Dashboard dashboard (V6), it could have a dropdown filter for folders to see the stats per collection, not just overall (smart way to integrate file tree option)


Bonus: Mathijs looked over and suggested to only use the tree/map if we introduce folder system for Evidence Section alone, then it would have proper hierarchy and we could display various versions.
