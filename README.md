# Learning Outcomes Explanation

### 1. Professional Duties << Beginning >>

Multiple design plans have been drawn and improved in iterations by following the feedback received as well as doing own research. It was successfully approved by stakeholders and the implementation has started. Work was carried out in iterations in line with the stakeholders’ expectations.
More profesional products such as production ready code and end-to-end testing still need to take place.

### 2. Situation-Orientation << Proficient >>

The Agile way of working is already know and thus was easy to get onboard with Scrum activites. Requirement gathering was also a familiar activity due to various green projects done in the past. In addition, a Double Diamond model was applied to help the design process and Figma was used to make digital Wireframes. Moreower, the profesional communication and initiative are also quite natural due to previous project based work involving various stakeholders.
Version Control, even though familiar, still needs more practice in the context of a larger team and better procedures.

### 3. Future-Oriented Organisation << Proficient >>

### 4. Investigative Problem Solving << Beginning >>

A good project phasing and frequent communication with the stakeholders help stay on top of the challenges. Keeping a log of daily activities and all received feedback is also very useful. However, more technical research should still take place as implementation phase has recently begun and it grows in complexity over time.

### 5. Personal Leadership << Orienting >>
