My name is Edita Pronckute, I am a Software Engineering student, doing my graduation internship in User Interaction. I have spent the last 5 months working with  ![image](https://github.com/EditaAnomaly/S8-GI-Drieam/assets/102149932/c699f5c4-57fb-4906-a6bb-16a800d3d741), an ed-tech company developing software solutions for educational institutions. One of their products is ‚ÄúPortflow‚Äù - a digital portfolio. The assignment was to improve the page in the portfolio where all the evidence of uploaded work is aggregated.

This repository serves as a portfolio for the Graduation Internship. All contents are divided into HBO-i activities - Analysis, Design, Realisation, Advice and Management. All the contents are listed below, the main headers will take you to a üìñ wiki page, that briefly explains the process and links to the results of each section. Most important files are highlighted with icons: üìñ Research Document and  üìÉ Internship Report. I recommend to either start with these two documents or to go over the üìñ wiki of the repository and choose what are the most interesting aspects of my assignment yourself.
